### Description of Files
* reel9_base_small.stl : main object which we call "base" hereafter.
* reel_sidesupport.stl : optional object which we call "support" hereafter.
* InstallationSampleImage.jpg : An illustration of assembly.

### How to Make
0. Find following materials in addition to your 3D printing preparation. 
   - 9 sticks of round edges square cross section of side <7mm (I use chopsticks)
   - A hot glue gun (I use >3 bullets for one reel)
   - 1 round stick of 14mm diameter (I use a chopstick and wide straw or tapioca straw)
   - Any structure to hold the reel at height (I use two A4 file boxes and clips)
1. Print one "base."
2. Place sticks through the holes of the "base."
3. Fill up any gap between the "base" and sticks with a hot glue gun.
4. Place the round stick through the hole of the real, and hold it at height so that the reel spins freely.

*** Optional ***<br>
Print two "supports" (provided in this repository or your design with a hole of 14mm diameter) to set the position of the reel nicely.

### How to Use
Weave your filament around the sticks of the reel.
